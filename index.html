				<h1> ABOUT ME</h1>
				<hr width="50%" align="left">
				<p>Hi, I am Edgar Miguel S Cuevas, 24 years old and an active student at University of Oslo. I am currently taking Single Courses: Realfag Masteremner. I got my bachelor's degree in Informatics: Programming and Network this January 2017. I am now working at an asian store as an acting supervisor, but I still consider myself as a store employee. What I love with my work now is that I tend to have conversations with customers about what they want with their food, what they need, and what food I can recommend them to make. I also help with some technical stuff at work, the usual Microsoft Office problems that is needed to be fixed and helping my colleagues to use Office in a better and easier way. But, even though I do computer work at my job, my dream is to work for an IT-firm that would help me grow as a programmer and improve my skills in IT. If I will have the opportunity to work for an IT-firm, I am very much open to start at beginning and learn from you, the experts, to be able to contribute more at work in the future. I can say that I am now ready to be part of an IT team. I like my work, but where I see myself in the future is alongside the people who can teach me more about my field of study and to be able to offer my help to others well. As of now, I am planning to proceed with my master's degree and to learn HTML,CSS and Javascript on my own online. </p>
